# DEPRECATED

As of August 2024 this package is deprecated and will receive no further updates.

Any internal changes should be made directly in `lu-greenfield`

## lu-test

Test helpers.

### coverage

If, after changing functionality, coverage is not 100%, the file `coverage/index.html` can be used to identify the code that isn't being tested, so that tests can be modified to cover it.
